Thank you for your interest in participating in our study. This study is led by researchers from the Delft University of Technology and is part of a bachelor thesis conducted by  Lina Sadoukri, Yushan Shan, Sagar Chethan Kumar and Manu Gautam.
 

The purpose of this research study is to investigate factors that relate to the willingness to disclose information to a mental health application. The study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The data will be used for scientific and educational purposes and may result in a scientific publication.
 

As part of this study, you will interact with a mental health chatbot. You will receive questions related to you, your mental health, and your well-being. We will not ask you to answer these questions, but rather to indicate how willing you would be to answer them. Additionally, we will ask you about your gender, age, and your agreement with certain statements (e.g., attitudes towards technology) through pre-task and post-task surveys. There are no right or wrong answers.
 

As with any online activity, there is a potential risk of data breach. We will minimize this risk by not collecting your name, contact details, or IP address. All data collected will be fully anonymous and cannot be traced back to you. Anonymous data may be publicly shared for scientific purposes.
 

Your participation is completely voluntary. If you do not complete your submission, your data will not be stored and your participation will be considered withdrawn.
 

If you have any questions or wish to omit any responses, please contact the responsible researcher:

You will interact with three different versions of a mental health support chatbot. During each interaction, please imagine that you are the person described in the role-play scenario below.

ðŸŽ­ Role-Play Scenario
	
Imagine you are a bachelor student at risk of expulsion because you havenâ€™t earned enough credits this academic year. This has become a major source of stress, seriously affecting your mental well-being and making it hard to concentrate on daily activities, including your studies.

You feel guilty toward your parents, believing that you could have performed better. You've considered dropping out, but you're unsure what you would do afterward. You're feeling lostâ€”confused, uncertain about your future, and unable to see a clear path forward.


ðŸ“Œ What Happens Next
After you click Next, you will be redirected to the chatbot interface where you will complete the task. The same role-play scenario described above will be shown again on the chatbot page for your reference.

Once you complete the chatbot interaction, you will return to this survey to answer a post-task questionnaire.",How would you rate your experience with chatbots in general? - I understand how chatbots work.,How would you rate your experience with chatbots in general? - I have interacted with chatbots before.,How would you rate your experience with chatbots in general? - I generally feel comfortable interacting with chatbots.,"General Trust in AI Systems
