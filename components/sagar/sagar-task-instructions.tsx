        You will interact with a mental health chatbot across <strong>three scenarios</strong>. 
        Each scenario presents a fixed dialogue that you should read carefully and imagine yourself 
        experiencing â€” immerse yourself in the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, the chatbot will ask you questions that involve self-disclosure.

        <strong>Important:</strong> You are <u>not</u> expected to actually share personal information. 
        Instead, indicate how willing you would be to answer each question and how severe or sensitive 
        you perceive it to be.

        After completing all <strong>three</strong> scenarios, you will be shown a page that allows you to redirect back to Qualtrics.
