        Welcome! In this task, you will be interacting with a <strong>voice-based chatbot</strong>.
        <br /><br />
        ðŸ‘‰ Please make sure your <strong>speakers are on</strong> â€” all messages will be audios, so it is important to listen carefully.
        <br /><br />
        You will go through <strong>three short scenarios</strong>:
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
          <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Tastes and Interests</li>
          <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Interpersonal Relationships and Self-Concept</li>
          <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Work or Studies</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Each scenario will include:
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
          <li><strong>Disclosure questions</strong> â€“ You will be asked to rate your willingness to share personal information.</li>
          <li><strong>Statements</strong> â€“ You will see a single response option. Please select it to continue the conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Thereâ€™s no pressure â€” just answer honestly and go at your own pace. Thanks for taking part!
